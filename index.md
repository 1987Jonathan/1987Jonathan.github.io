[Machine Learning Class Presentation](/pdf/ML Presentation.pdf)<br><br> In this presentation for our Machine Learning class, we delve into the details of our project, which involved applying various machine learning models to a real-world dataset. We begin by explaining how we structured and preprocessed the data to make it suitable for analysis. Our exploration of different machine learning models highlighted that the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy compared to the other models we tested.

The primary goal of this project was to gain practical experience with different machine learning techniques and to apply these methods to a real-life scenario. For a comprehensive view of our findings and methodologies, you can access the full presentation.

[NLP Class Activity: Analyzing Literary Texts](/pdf/aholland_jjmcgechie_NLPPROJECT.pdf)<br><br> In this class activity, I collaborated with a partner to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm aimed at analyzing the use of masculine and feminine subject and objective pronouns in three classic novels: Moby Dick, Little Women, and Little Men.

The objective of our NLP analysis was to examine the distribution and usage patterns of these pronouns across the texts, providing insights into gender representation and linguistic trends within these literary works.

[Exploring the Barriers to Affordable Housing in Oregon](/pdf/Capstone_2024.pdf)<br><br> For our capstone project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the affordable housing landscape in Oregon. Working closely with my project partner, we demonstrated various aspects of our graduate education, including Data Engineering, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Statistical Thinking, and Data Ethics. Our project involved both a comprehensive write-up and a presentation.

Through our research, we discovered that Oregon faces a significant deficit in available homes. However, the state has begun implementing measures to address this issue. Notably, legislation has been enacted requiring all counties to report housing data and make it publicly accessible. Despite these efforts, we observed a lack of historical land sale records, which complicates the analysis. Additionally, we found that house prices in less populated counties are often inflated due to the inclusion of land with the home.

One of the key legislative initiatives is H.B. 2001, aimed at making homeownership more affordable in Oregon. While this is a positive step, our findings suggest that further action is needed to fully address the housing affordability crisis.

[Final project for Intro SaaS/ProServ Sales]
In our final project for the Intro to SaaS/ProServ Sales course, we developed a comprehensive sales pitch for Wide World Importers, focusing on addressing a key challenge within their operations. Our solution centered around enhancing their refrigeration trucks by integrating advanced monitoring, recording, tracking, and repair systems for their tractor trailers.

We proposed a cutting-edge solution designed to streamline and optimize the management of refrigeration units. This included real-time monitoring to ensure consistent temperature control, recording data for compliance and analysis, and tracking system performance to predict maintenance needs. Additionally, we introduced a repair management component to minimize downtime and ensure the efficiency of the fleet.

Our pitch aimed to showcase how these enhancements could improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure the reliability of refrigerated transport, ultimately delivering substantial value to Wide World Importers.
